# Effects of Stylistic Post-Processing Image Filters on Gaze Fixation Prediction
This is an ongoing research project. Check back soon for updates.

## Demo
This project uses `[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)` for managing
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/) dependencies, and git submodules for any packages not
found on PyPI. To get the project up and running after cloning it, you will
need to run the following commands.

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
uv run main.py
```

We also provide a `requirements.txt` file, in case you would like to manage your
PyPI dependencies manually instead of using `uv`.
